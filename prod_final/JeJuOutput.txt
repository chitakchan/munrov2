mapping in degrees:  upper left (x,y) = (126.04, 33.70) with  (width, height) = ( 1.15, -0.62 ).
in km of easting and northing:  upper left (e,n) = (95.86, 77.18) with  (width, height) = (107.77, -69.33 ).

3D print size: with print scale of 1.12 mm : 1000 m (Note 1)
print width (top of trapezium), 120.00 mm : 107030.00 m
print depth of sea bed from ground level, -2.02 mm : -1800.0 m( 6.7 layers (Note 2))
print depth of base from sea bed to bottom, -6.73 mm : -6000.0 m( 22.4 layers)
print height of ben nevis, 10.23 mm (exaggerated at 5.0 ): 1824.0 m (elevation from dem file)( 34.1 layers)

Note 1. to achieve the above, apply 1.12 in Repetitier Host. 

Note 2. As each print layer is 0.30 mm, allow about two layers
for the seabed and six layers for the base (from seabed to bottom), 
calculate back to meter in hdr input file

Note 3. total no. of layers = 63.2

Note 4. it is desirable to have 3 layers printed at top surface, no layer printed at the bottom, and 
whatever in-between is infill with pattern like honeycomb.
